Last Sunday, I went out for drinks. On Monday, learned how to embroider. Tuesday I biked 25km. Wednesday I biked a bit then the bike back tire went out, so I went home. Logged it as a run. This inspired me to try a run. I challenged 5km on another day. Wednesday, I don't even know what I did. Probably worked on this website. Thursday, I had work. Friday, I ran the 5k, then I went out and bought the tire for my bike.
